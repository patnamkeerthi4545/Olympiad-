\item  Find all integers $a,b,c$ with $1 < a < b < c$ such that
$(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)$ is a divisor of $abc$ - $1$.

\item Let ${R}$ denote the set of all real numbers. Find all functions $f : {R}$ $\rightarrow$ ${R}$ such that
\begin{align*}
f(x^{2}+f(y))=y+(f(x))^{2}  
\end{align*}
for all $x, y$ $\epsilon$ $R$.
\item Consider nine points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair of points is joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is either coloured blue or red or left uncoloured. Find the smallest value of $n$ such that whenever exactly $n$ edges are coloured, the set of coloured edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same color.

\item In the plane let $C$ be a circle, $L$ a line tangent to the circle $C$, and $M$ a point on $L$. Find the locus of all points $P$ with the following property: there exists two points $Q,R$ on $L$ such that $M$ is the midpoint of $QR$ and $C$ is the inscribed circle of triangle $PQR$.

\item Let $S$ be a finite set of points in three-dimensional space. Let $S_x$, $S_y$, $S_z$ be the sets consisting of the orthogonal projections of the points of $S$ onto the $yz$-plane, $zx$-plane, $xy$-plane, respectively. Prove that
\begin{align*}
|S|^{2} \leq |S_x| \cdot |S_y| \cdot |S_z|,
\end{align*}
where $|A|$ denotes the number of elements in the finite set $|A|$. (Note: The orthogonal projection of a point onto a plane is the foot of the perpendicular from that point to the plane.)

\item For each positive integer $n$, $S(n)$ is defined to be the greatest integer such that, for every positive integer $k$ $\leq$ $S(n)$, $n^{2}$ can be written as the sum of $k$ positive squares. 

$\brak a$ Prove that $S(n)$ $\leq$ $n^{2}$ - $14$ for each $n \geq 4$. 

$\brak b$ Find an integer $n$ such that $S(n)=n^{2}-14$.

$\brak c$ Prove that there are infintely many integers $n$ such that $S(n) = {n^{2}}-14$.
